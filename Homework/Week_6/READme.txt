The intention of this linked view is to (when completed) show a relation between the GDP of countries and the percentage of population living in urban areas. 
Currently I also added population density as a viewable option, which might be removed if not useful enough. 

Initially the idea was that when a data category is selected (e.g. GDP/urban population percentage/etc.) both a world map and a bar chart get updated in their color. 
When a country or bar is pressed it then gets highlighted on both plots. 

However I intent to make the linked view more interesting by possibly replacing the barchart with a scatterplot, which plots urban population percentage against GDP, 
with size perhaps representing a third variable. The dots on the scatterplot could be clickable, then showing for example a linechart which plots urban population
percentage and GDP for that specific country throughout the last few decades.
